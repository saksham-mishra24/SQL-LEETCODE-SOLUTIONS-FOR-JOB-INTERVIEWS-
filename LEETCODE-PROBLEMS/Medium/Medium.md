# üìù SQL Problem #1: Find the Missing IDs

## üöÄ Problem Statement

present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order. 

### Example Input
Here‚Äôs an example of the input table(s):

#### `Table: Customer`
Customer table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+

### Expected Output

| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+

## üí° Solution

### Query
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    -- Anchor member: Start with the minimum customer_id
    SELECT MIN(customer_id) AS n, MAX(customer_id) AS max_id
    FROM Customer

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: Increment n by 1 until it reaches max_id
    SELECT n + 1 AS n, max_id
    FROM CTE
    WHERE n < max_id
)
-- Final query: Select only the generated sequence
SELECT n
FROM CTE
EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
```






# üìù SQL Problem #2: Bank Account Summary


## üöÄ Problem Statement
eetcode Bank (LCB) helps its coders in making virtual payments. Our bank records all transactions in the table Transaction, we want to find out the current balance of all users and check wheter they have breached their credit limit (If their current credit is less than 0).

+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+


### Expected Output
Result table:
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+

| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+


### Expected Output

+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| Annabelle     | 3           | 3        | 2020-07-31 |

| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.

### Query
```sql

WITH RankedOrders AS (
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name, 
        o.customer_id,           
        o.order_id,              
        o.order_date,             
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date DESC) AS rn

    JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
)
SELECT
    customer_name,
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM RankedOrders
WHERE rn <= 3  -- Only select the top 3 most recent orders
ORDER BY customer_name ASC,  -- Sort by customer name in ascending order
         customer_id ASC,    -- If names tie, sort by customer ID
         order_date DESC;     -- Finally, by order date in descending order

```
